    "## Rollout Cleaning Schedule Optimization using Heuristic Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates optimizing heliostat cleaning schedules (number of cleaning crews) in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants using a condition-based heuristic approach. The method was presented within the conferrence SolarPACES (2024) - Rome, Italy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Overview\n",
    "The model performs the following key functions:\n",
    "* Evaluates current field performance and soiling impacts on reflectivity\n",
    "* Forecasts energy production under different cleaning scenarios\n",
    "* Analyzes cleaning costs vs performance gains\n",
    "* Makes dynamic cleaning decisions based on revenue optimization (using perfect knowledge forecasting across a horizon equal the time it takes to clean the full field)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Considerations\n",
    "The optimization accounts for real operational constraints including:\n",
    "* Limited cleaning resources\n",
    "* Receiver saturation limits  \n",
    "* Heliostat field layout\n",
    "* Weather conditions and soiling rates\n",
    "* Daily/seasonal solar variations\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic uses a rolling horizon to determine optimal timing and targeting of heliostat cleaning operations while maximizing plant economics."
